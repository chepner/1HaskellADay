-- It is said by some wise old philosophers philosophizing that all you need is
-- 2000 words to express yourself in a language. How accurate is that statement?
-- Using everyday sentences found anywhere you'd like and the wordsfreqs, show
-- which words of those sentences are in the wordsfreqs corpus.

-- metaquestion: is 'corpus' in the corpus?
-- metametaquestion: is 'metaquestion' in the corpus?
