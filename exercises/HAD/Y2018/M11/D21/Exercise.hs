"A curious identity involving π and e:"

1 / (π² + 1) + 1 / (4π² + 1) + 1 / (9π² + 1) + 1 / (16π² + 1) + ... = 1 / (e² - 1)

How many terms do you have to go out for that equation to be accurate within
0.1? 0.01? 0.001? 0.0001?

pie :: Int -> Double
pie nterms = undefined

-- pie returns the value of the sum of the first n π² terms minus the e term
